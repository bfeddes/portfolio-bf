                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p> Hey everyone, my name is Brian Feddes, I am 20 years old, and love sports. 
                    I come from a large family as I have seven siblings.
                    I also have multiple nephews and nieces, so you can imagine holidays get chaotic.
                    I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science as it has been my dream to do so since I 
                    was around 13 years old. Computers have always fascinated me and I am super excited
                    to continue feeding my fascination through my work and schooling. </p>

                <h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h3>
                <p>I love to be outdoors. Nearly every summer my family and I travel across the United States
                    and visit national parks. Last summer I went to Canyonlands, Arches, and Rocky Mountains 
                    national parks. In my life so far, I have also been able to visit Yellowstone and Glacier 
                    national parks as well. One of the things I do while visiting these parks is collect 
                    stickers from each one, as they serve as great memories of the visit.</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                <p>A fun fact about myself is that I played both basketball and volleyball in high school, 
                    and greatly enjoyed both I believe team sports are extremely beneficial for not only your
                    health, but also for your future. Participating in team sports helps you learn how to work
                    with a team, keep your composure, follow guidance, and build bonds.</p>
